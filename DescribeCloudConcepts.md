- Artificial Intelligence

Cloud is like having a computer but it on the internet, someone else looks after it and you just have to select your desired resources, like storage and computing power. Of course the price varies as well.

### Describe the shared responsibility model

If you had an on-premises datacenter, the owner would be the responsible of everything, from the hardware and software maintenance to providing support to the applications.

When working with cloud, these responsabilities vary depending on the service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS):

- Your responsabilities:

    The information and data stored in the cloud

    Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
    
    The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

- Cloud provider's:

    - The physical datacenter
    - The physical network
    - The physical hosts

- Depending on the service:

    - Operating systems

    - Network controls

    - Applications

    - Identity and infrastructure
