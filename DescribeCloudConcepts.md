### Introduction to Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that, among other things, offers:

- Remote storage

- Database hosting

- Centralized account management

- Artificial Intelligence

- Internet of Things

### What is cloud computing

*Cloud computing* is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Such as:

- Virtual machines

- Storage 

- Databases 

- Networking

- Internet of things 

- Machine Learning 

- Artificial Intelligence

Cloud is like having a computer but it on the internet, someone else looks after it and you just have to select your desired resources, like storage and computing power. Of course the price varies as well.

### Describe the shared responsibility model

With an on-premises datacenter, the owner would be the responsible of everything, from the hardware and software maintenance to providing support to the applications.

When working with cloud, these responsabilities vary depending on the service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS):

- Your responsabilities:

    The information and data stored in the cloud

    Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
    
    The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

- Cloud provider's:

    - The physical datacenter
    - The physical network
    - The physical hosts

- Depending on the service:

    - Operating systems

    - Network controls

    - Applications

    - Identity and infrastructure

### Define cloud models

Cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. There are three main kinds of cloud models.

#### Private cloud

It's having a datacenter specific to your company.

It could be owned by the company or by paying a third-party but it's costly and doesn't offer all the benefits that a public cloud does.

#### Public cloud

It's a third-party service where anyone can purchase cloud services and use resources.

#### Hybrid cloud

It's the choice of a user to host some things on a public and others in a private cloud. It allows to have data with different security levels and allows the company to easily scale up when needed.

#### Other options

##### Multi-cloud 

It's the scenario where the architecture is divided into several clouds.

##### Azure Arc

Set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environmetn.

##### Azure VMware Solution

This solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

### Describe the consumption-based model

There are two kinds of expenses to consider: 

- Capital expenditure (CapEx)

    One time, up-front expenditure to purchase tangible resources. (Building, datacenter, parking lot)

- Operational expenditure (OpEx)

    Spending money on services over time. (Cloud-based services, a lease)

## Describe the benefits of using cloud services
