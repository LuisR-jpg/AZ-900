## Describe cloud computing

### Introduction to Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that, among other things, offers:

- Remote storage

- Database hosting

- Centralized account management

- Artificial Intelligence

- Internet of Things

### What is cloud computing

*Cloud computing* is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Such as:

- Virtual machines

- Storage 

- Databases 

- Networking

- Internet of things 

- Machine Learning 

- Artificial Intelligence

Cloud is like having a computer but it on the internet, someone else looks after it and you just have to select your desired resources, like storage and computing power. Of course the price varies as well.

### Describe the shared responsibility model

With an on-premises datacenter, the owner would be the responsible of everything, from the hardware and software maintenance to providing support to the applications.

When working with cloud, these responsabilities vary depending on the service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS):

- Your responsabilities:

    The information and data stored in the cloud

    Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
    
    The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

- Cloud provider's:

    - The physical datacenter
    - The physical network
    - The physical hosts

- Depending on the service:

    - Operating systems

    - Network controls

    - Applications

    - Identity and infrastructure

### Define cloud models

Cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. There are three main kinds of cloud models.

#### Private cloud

It's having a datacenter specific to your company.

It could be owned by the company or by paying a third-party but it's costly and doesn't offer all the benefits that a public cloud does.

#### Public cloud

It's a third-party service where anyone can purchase cloud services and use resources.

#### Hybrid cloud

It's the choice of a user to host some things on a public and others in a private cloud. It allows to have data with different security levels and allows the company to easily scale up when needed.

#### Other options

##### Multi-cloud 

It's the scenario where the architecture is divided into several clouds.

##### Azure Arc

Set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environmetn.

##### Azure VMware Solution

This solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.

### Describe the consumption-based model

There are two kinds of expenses to consider: 

- Capital expenditure (CapEx)

    One time, up-front expenditure to purchase tangible resources. (Building, datacenter, parking lot)

- Operational expenditure (OpEx)

    Spending money on services over time. (Cloud-based services, a lease)

## Describe the benefits of using cloud services

### Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud.

Two of the biggest considerations when deploying an application are:

- Uptime/Availabitily

- Ability to handle demand/scale

#### High availability

Azure provides uptime guarantees depending on the service.

Based on the service-level agreements. These agreements lie between azure and clients, or a TI department of a building with the business clients.
There are: 99% 99.9% 99.95% 99.99% guarantees, each one way more expensive than the previous.

#### Scalability

It allows to handle demand. You don't have to overpay all the time, just pay what you use.

##### Vertical Scaling

Resources grow in size. You could add more CPUs or RAM to the VM. 

##### Horizontal Scaling

In this case, additional virtual machines or containers are addded. 

### Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud.

#### Reliability

It's the ability of a system to recover from failures. In some cases, your resources will shift to a different region for you.

#### Predictability

This lets you move forward with confidence. Cost and performance are predictable with Azure.

##### Performance

Performance predictability is supported by autoscaling, lod balancing and high availability.

##### Cost

Tools like Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or Pricing Calculator help know how much your resources will spend.

### Describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud.

#### Governance

Things like templates help ensure that all your deployed resources meet corporate standards, and you can update them when standards change.

Auditing helps flag and mitigate any resource out of compliance.

#### Security

You can choose between services so you could either take care of your own security or let it be taken care of.

Also, cloud is well suited to handle DDoS and more attacks.

### Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud.

#### Management of the cloud 

It speaks to managing your cloud resources. You can autoscale, deploy resources, monitor, receive alerts.

#### Management in the cloud

You're able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage through a web portal, command line, APIs, Powershell.
